Where we are:
    Metrics measured on GitHub commits
        Number of commits per person, per repo, and total
        Number of curses per person, per repo, and total

What needs to be fixed:
    Email notifications when a certain threshold of commits is reached
    The mysterious commit-counter flip images bug

Where we plan on going:
    More statistics of the commits
    Real-time graph on the front end
